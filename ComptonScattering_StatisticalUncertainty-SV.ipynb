The Poisson distribution is an appropriate model for how these count rates vary statistically. \n",

It's an estimate of the 'true' mean, or population mean, of the distribution, but you can't say they are exactly the same because you only used a finite number of measurements of $R_0$ to determine $\\bar{R_0}$, over a short time interval. There is statistical uncertainty as $\\bar{R_0}$ as an estimate of $\\mu_{R_0}$. This uncertainty is known in statistics as \"standard error\". \n",

Also the statistical uncertainty is larger if the original Poisson distribution has larger standard deviation. Standard error (SE) is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution and dividing by the square root of the number of samples you used to calculate the sample mean. For $SE_{R_0}$ this translates to\n",
