    "Each of the count rate measurements is a sample measurement of a statistical process, meaning that if you measured them again, there would be some variation to the measurements - not because of some malfunction of the counting device but because the actual number of counts randomly varies following a Poisson distribution. Let's assume the count rate follows a statistical distribution; the Poisson distribution to be precise, with population mean $\\mu_C$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_C=\\sqrt{\\mu_C}$.\n",

    "Your measurement of $R_C$ can be thought of as a sample mean of the count rate's Poisson distribution. It's an estimate of the population mean, $\\mu_C$, because you estimated it from a sample of measurements taken over a finite time interval. As an estimate, it contains statistical uncertainty; we can't say for certain that $\\mu_C=R_C$ for example. The fewer measurements, or equivalently the shorter time interval over which $R_C$ was measured, the greater this uncertainty. There is also more uncertainty in the sample mean being a good approximation to the population mean if the actual statistical distribution is spread widely, i.e. large $\\sigma_C$. \n",
